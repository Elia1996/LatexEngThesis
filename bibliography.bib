@article{Asanovic2014,
	abstract = {The increasing popularity of systems on a chip, where processors are just a small fraction of the design, calls into question why one of the most important interfaces is proprietary. We argue that: There is no good technical reason not to have free, open instruction sets just as we have free, open networking standards and free, open operating systems. The most likely first targets for a free, open instruction set are systems on a chip for the Internet of Things, which have low cost and power demands, and for Warehouse Scale Computers, which could benefit from viable alternatives to the 80x86 instruction set The best architectural style for a free, open instruction set is RISC. Given the time it takes to design an instruction set, it makes more sense to adopt an existing RISC free, open instruction set than to design a new one from scratch. Among the existing RISC free, open instruction sets, RISC-V is the best and safest choice.},
